Budget Buddy Application

Budget Buddy is a simple application to create a budget and track a savings goal.

Budget Buddy contains five pages: home page, budget page, savings page, resource
page, and an about developers page.  The pages are organized around a theme of
a manilla folder with navigational tabs.

The application user will enter be asked to enter three pieces of information:
  * total amount of income to be budgeted per month.
  * expense totals for a variety of categories.
  * an inspiring savings goal.

The application will report back an informative pie chart of the users monthly
expenses as well as a savings goal with a progress bar.  

The developers used javascript constructor objects and methods along with
Chart.js to complete the project.
